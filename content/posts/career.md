The next chapter of my life will be spent as a SWE at Microsoft.  Maybe it is just a feeling, but the last year or so was me taking some hard L's (losses) - just take my word for it. I know that this is just life, but I have been down for a while now and it's cool to see that in spite of this, my hard work has payed off . Studying, projects, research and a much tougher schedule, I've really had to manage a lot of stress these past few months. Anxiety about getting the job I want, doing a lot of interviews and applying, suffice it to say I'm *so* happy this semester is coming to a close .


I'm psyched about Microsoft and I'm psyched to live in Seattle. I'll do everything I can to do an excellent job there
