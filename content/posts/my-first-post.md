Hi!
I am Daniel Moore and this is my blog!
I have created two blogs in the past where I talked about technology in one and political theory in the other. This is a place where I will place my thoughts, notes and anything I find interesting! I am a software engineer attending UT Austin, and am good at systems, web applications, and cloud computing. I have taken 9 hours of machine learning coursework at UT Austin, but my passion lies in programming and creating things that are useful! The creative and challening nature of programming is what I love about, I have always been good at mathematics as a kid (got a 169 quant on the GRE!) and started to love programming after I built a clone of my favorite childhood game in pure Java using object oriented principles and I implemented the physics/hit detection engine - super meat boy is the name of the game if you've heard of it. It was ~2500 lines of code I think

But yeah, here I am, a senior, looking for my first job out of college. I am interviewing a lot right now, so my schedule is busy but I wanted to create this blog as I go through this process!

-Daniel
