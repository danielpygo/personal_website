[Mirrors](http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=3903
)
Why do mirrors reflect:
1. Nature of the metal
Electrons are loosely attached to metals and are able to
For visible light (low frequency), the electrons can match the speed
and reflect the light. For UV, it is too high so it doesn't reflect

Different metals reflect different wavelengths
The highest frequency light reflected is called <b>plasma frequency</b>
This differs between metals, steel is high

2. "Mirrors reflect mainly bc they are electrically conductive"
When it hits a mirror the metal cancels out the electric field
parallel to the mirror, so it changes directions and reflects away.

3. Silver cannot absorb the light, light cannot travel through silver,
so it bounces off and returns to your eye.
