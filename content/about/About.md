<p>
Currently, I am a student at The University of Texas at Austin and am majoring in Computer Science. My expertise is in Cloud Computing and Software Engineering (Applications/Backend). I am excellent at C++, Java and Go. I have done a lot of coding in Python as well for artificial intelligence related courses
</p>
<p>
I am a software engineer attending UT Austin, and am good at systems, applications, and cloud computing!

<p>
Other interests include food, cooking, writing, podcasts and extreme ferret racing! One thing I want to do before I die is travel to Italy or spend a day with Karl Pilkington. I have a love/hate relationship with sleep and one day want to learn a lot about architecture so that I can design my dream house.
