The Game Begat the Player


With any discipline, challenge, or complexity - a difficult game always excites the clever player who tries to bend the rules in his favor. It's a cat and mouse game where people try to gain a competitive advantage over one and other . The ingenuinity and creativity of hackers, startups, poker players and of people in dating, politics and gaming, always impresses me. People push things forward for its own sake - it's just fun. I love a challenge and complexity
