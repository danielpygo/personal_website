I prepared quite a bit for the MS interview - studying at least 100 LC questions and I chose to do the coding in C++. I saw so many interview questions and did so many hacker-ranks/interviews that the MS interview wasn't too difficult. I was prepared for it and had a list of questions I wanted to ask as well - I asked If there is anything frustrating about working there, what the most successful team members do that separates them, challenges in their department and a few business-type questions. It is easy to ask fluff/meaningless questions about company culture or work-life balance, but I wanted to challenge the interviewers a little and see what they would say.


Their responses were interesting and insightful - I still remember each of their answers actually - one talked about the problem of serendipidity for recommendations and how to evaluate UI effectiveness, one talked about training AI recommendation models while not using too many resources, and another talked about dealing with and diagnosing stagnant growth.


Overall, I had a great experience interviewing at MS. The driver who picked me up from the airport, Mike, was encouraging and we talked the whole way back about random things. He gave me some recommendations for places to drive to if I decide to drive from Austin to Seattle. I really am curious as to whether or not he is more associated with MS than he leads out to be. I have a conspiracy theory that he may give feedback to MS about the interviewees that he drives. A spy - people definitely confide a lot in this guy because he just has great charisma and he's nonthreatening. I have a few other reasons for this conspiracy but I don't want to go into it here.


After getting to the hotel, I slept and woke up really early so that I was one of the first ones there. Did the interviews, then had lunch with some other interviewees. I was pretty drained but they were all cool and I hope they got the offer too.
