I just watched Exit Through The Gift Shop (2010) the other night and it has to be my favorite documentary. It's about graffiti art and produced by Banksy. It's a documentary started by a crazy but hilarious french cameraman, Thierry, but eventually finished by Banksy, the most famous and unmasked graffiti artist alive. Thierry, the cameraman, could never finish because he had collected thousands of hours of film over 8 years, with no real plan or storyline. And so finally Banksy took over the film and made it a film about himself.


Banksy said that his motivation to get the documentary film out was to tell the real story about what street art is about, because suddenly it had become all about the money - the message and authenticity had been lost.


The film calls into question the tired phrase that everything is art, and I think Banksy was trying to say that art must have some skill and authenticity. Thierry, after all, ripped off Banksy and does not really have any deep or compelling thoughts behind his work. He mass produced contemporary art and yet the art collectors at his first show were calling his work brilliant and spending thousands! 


It's a criticism about the Art world - Why can't experts distinguish between great art and bad art? Banksy loathes these kinds of people more than Thierry himself, the types that find meaning, brilliance and depth that isn't there.


I mean what is art after all? It's a way to convey human emotion or a message. There are a lot of different opinions on this matter, I learned from a philosophy class I during my freshman year of college. I don't agree that anything can be art and I don't think trying to define art is worthwhile because there's too many outliers, exceptions and caveats. We know art when we see it, is my opinion. I don't pretend to know much about art but the Banksy documentary was thought-provoking and shows a very rare look into the world of street art.
