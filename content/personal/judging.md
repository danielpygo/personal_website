I watched a Vice documentary on an infamous character in American culture, and it was one of those moments where you realize you had been totally wrong about someone. The editing and narrative by Vice, was obviously trying to show a different perspective on this guy, and by the end of it the reporter seemed charmed with him and maaaybbeee had a crush on him as well

One of the top YouTube comments was "It's like someone from twitch chat became a millionaire". And actually that is the perfect summary, because the person in question has always been a loner, came from humble beginnings, and loves to troll

But yeah I came out of the documentary with a different perspective on him - I like him - I would hang out with him. You can tell he is a fun and interesting person

It's fine to hate someone, but the lesson I took away from it is: See for yourself; It's always important to establish first principles. Remember in high school when a few people of a group may not like you very much, they start badmouthing you to the group, and then before you know it this group of people you never talk to, just hates you for little to no reason? It's aggravating because I think they don't even know why they didn't like me. Things just escalate and linger;  this new formed opinion leads to a spiral of negativity.

Now, I avoid badmouthing people and I like when people try to as well. It just feels dirty, they aren't there to defend themselves. Usually from my experience, there is an underlying reason like jealousy or spite that fuels such vitriolic words
