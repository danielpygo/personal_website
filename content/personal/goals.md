In 5 years I see myself working for a large tech company like Amazon/Google/Microsoft and building my skills to become an integral and useful developer. I have found that I get happiness when I see personal growth and by being ambitious/useful.


I plan on getting a few certificates and eventually doing an online masters program in the next 5 years. Building my github portfolio more is something I want to do more out of college. Right now I have about ~25 public repos, and like ~40 total including private repos, but I want to do more on Github.


Would also like to read more books when I graduate from college, CS books and also nonfiction books. I want to write more and learn more about topics that interest me. In college there is always something looming over me, tests, homework, applying, etc. This will be a great change in pace, I can just focus on doing an excellent job at work but at night I can do what I want!


Learn a language: I am half bulgarian and it is real embarassing that I know like zero bulgarian. I recently learned a lot of my ancestry, and think it would be cool to learn the language to surprise my family in Bulgaria. I can't imagine their face when I understand what they said and respond well in bulgarian haha.


I want to get into stocks. Win or lose, stocks are always such a fun thing to follow for me. I like doing research on companies and putting money in companies I believe in!


I also want to get more into fashion and get clothes that isn't career fair swag aha. I'm a walking ad rn
