Happiness, in my opinion, is what you feel after success in wherever your ambitions lie. It doesn't come after being stagnant and complacent, but rather it comes after you overcome hardship. I don't think I am especially happy yet, but I know that I am happier than I have been in 2-3 years. I have part of my life figured out - relationship and job-wise.

Technology-wise I will be happy once I become proficient in Javascript with a few projects and also finish a medium-sized project I've been thinking of in C++.
