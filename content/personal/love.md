There's nothing worse than a relationship on its last leg and that's kind of where I have been for the last 3 months. It was miserable, but last night I felt like a weight was lifted off me and that I could finally breathe easy again. With so many rules, forbidden topics, and arguments/accusations, it was starting to feel like an adverserial game .

Like, we weren't on the same team. Blame being thrown around, baggage and me constantly trying to get some sort of apology or acknowledgement of past wrongdoings or words which had never really been resolved in my head, these were all problems of conflict . Most days were fantastic, though.

I think I have thicker skin than most and don't really hold grudges, but there is something about acknowledgement or apologies that shows good character (it's an impressive display of maturity and also love).  In general, I am happy with how it ended and am excited for new memories and what is to come!
