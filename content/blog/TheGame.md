The Game Begat the Player
</p>
<p>
With any discipline, challenge, or complexity - a difficult game always excites the clever player who tries to bend the rules in his favor. A cat and mouse game where humans try to gain a competitive advantage over one and other. The ingenuinity and creativity of hackers, startups, poker players and of people in dating, politics and gaming, never ceases to excite me. People push things forward for its own sake - it's just fun - there is no system or paradigm that isn't constantly shifting. I love a challenge and complexity, that's why I'm a CS major

I consume a lot of podcasts/media and I have noticed something about myself. The celebrities that have influenced me the most, ever since I was a kid, are the ones that are misunderstood, maybe it is because I feel that way about myself sometimes
